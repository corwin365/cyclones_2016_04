Many of the functions used in this analysis were not written by me, but instead sourced from other locations. Since tey may be covered by other licenses than the one I have used, they are not distributed with the code for this paper. This file lists the provenance of all files excluded from the package.

=====================================================

get_MLS
  - Matlab routine for reading MLS-formatted HDF5 data, provided by JPL for non-commercial use 
  - https://mls.jpl.nasa.gov/data/readers.php

m_map
  - set of (somewhat dated) mapping routines for Matlab
  - https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html

ncarray
  - netcdf interfacing routines, used to read data only
  - http://octave.sourceforge.net/ncarray/

st, strans, gwindow
  - routines implementing the S-Transform in Matlab. These were obtained from Robert Stockwell's CoRA website. This is no longer available at time of writing, so you may need to write your own or obtain an alernative package. The mathematics underlying it are covered by Stockwell et al, IEEE Trans 1996. 

Remaining all obtained from the Matlab File Exchange, and available at time of writing:
=====================================================

export_fig 
  - this exports the image to an external file, including some anti-aliasing and scaling

cbrewer
  - this provides a Matlab interface to the Brewer colour table set. See Harrower and Brewer, Cartogr. J., 2003

subtightplot
  - overrides Matlab subfigure spacing

bin2mat
  - fast 2d binning routine

datevec2doy
  - converts Matlab-formatted date information to day-of-year

freezeColors
  - overrides Matlab's native colour handling, allowing multiple colour tables on the same plot

inpaint_nans
  - fills in NaNs in N-dimensional arrays using a range of interpolation methods. Only used where I was sure the gaps filled were small after hand-checking. Make sure you check this too as different versions of the the raw data may have different gaps, and this routine will happily ``interpolate'' over a dataset containing no data and millions of NaNs if you tell it to.

regexpdir
  - regular-expression-aware file-location routine

sinefit
  - implements the IEEE-1057 sine-fitting routine in Matlab

textprogressbar
  - outputs a progress bar to screen

wildcardsearch
  - wildcard-aware file search routine
